# ListApp
## Yet another to do list application, but with Backbone!

* Thought it would be great to learn [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)
* Built a to-do list app (that I actually use!) to keep track of my shopping list and other random errands I need to do.

## Version History

### Latest
* Supporting both `touchend` and `click` events for app interaction
* New "item details" modal
* WIP - toggling done-state of item in item details modal

### 0.1a
* September 7th, 2012
* Added support for creating and editing new items, and toggling done state of items (pretty much all that was covered in the tutorial, heh)
